Evil FizzBuzz
Working as a single team, deliver a program that satisfies the following requirements:  
 Generates a list of integers from 1...100  
 Replaces any integers that are divisible by  3 with ‘Fizz’  
 Replaces any integers that are divisible by 5 with ‘Buzz’  
 Replaces any integers that are divisible by 3 and 5 with ‘FizzBuzz’  
 Outputs this list as a single comma-delimited string (i.e., ‘1,2,Fizz,4,Buzz,Fizz,7...’ etc  

Here are the rules for this exercise:
1. The finished program must be demonstrated working on the instructor’s laptop
2. Each person in your team can only write code – including tests – for one of these
requirements
3. You must merge your code into a single shared GitHub repository
4. You must set-up a Continuous Integration pipeline for your repository that checks out the
code from the main branch, builds it and runs the tests on every check-in
5. Once the CI build has gone green, it must never fail again, or the exercise is over
6. The last check-in must happen within 60 minutes


Room 1 - on task 1
Room 2 - on task 2
etc...
